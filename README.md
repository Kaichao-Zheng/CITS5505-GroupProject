# Master Group 63

## Intro

**⚠️This `README.md` is a draft for GitHub preview while the project is in progress.**

It will be replaced by another `README.md` to explain the project, as required by the project specification.

---

Use following code to clone remote repo to local:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Kaichao-Zheng/CITS5505-GroupProject.git
```

⚠️**Please always work on `yourOwnBranch`, NOT on the `origin/main` branch, which should only be used for merging.**
