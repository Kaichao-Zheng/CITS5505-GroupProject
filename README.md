## High-Priority Tasks

- [x] Convert hardcoded HTML into Jinja blocks
- [ ] Design **JavaScript** to interact backend routes defined by `@app.route()` or `@api_bp.route()`
- [ ] To be continued

## Known Challenges

- [ ] Dynamic CSR in search result
- [ ] Line chart visualization
- [ ] Price prediction and visualization
- [ ] Reuse search functionality in "share user selection"
- [ ] [Optional] Real-time fuzzy search

## Tech Stacks

* HTML
* CSS + Bootstrap
* JavaScript + jQuery
* Flask (SSR)
* AJAX (CSR)
* SQL-Alchemy (ORM for application-database interaction)
